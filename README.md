<b># AVR-ASM-WWVB-Atomic-Clock</b><br>
Atomic Clock based on WWVB 60kHz time signal - written for AVR/Arduino in Assembler<br>
Created by Benjamin Russell.  For personal use only.<br>
<b>*** PROJECT IN PROGRESS ***</b><br>
• Circuit/displays seem to interfere with reception of WWVB, so PWM signal had to be simulated<br>
• Program seems to now work as intended but have not yet tested with a live WWVB signal<br>
